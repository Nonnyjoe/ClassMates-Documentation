* Fill the Form displayed in the modal by passing in the required details of;&#x20;

1. **Organization Name:** This represents the name of the Organization the program is being created for.
2. **Admin Name:** This is the name of the user creating the program, this is necessary because each admin and user address is mapped to the individuals name for easy identification on the dApp.
3. **Program Name:** This represents the name of the actual program being created, in certain organisation this is equivalent to the track name or even the cohort name / number.

* Submitting the form form the previous bullet point generates a transaction which triggers our browser wallet to display a transaction requesting our signature. Click on the Confirm button to submit the request to create a program onchain.

* Depending on network congestion, after a couple of seconds the request is finalized on chain and if successful the requested program is created and the account used in signing the previous transaction request becomes the active moderator of the program at that moment.
