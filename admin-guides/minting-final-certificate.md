* A modal box containing a 3 input form should pop-up at this point, you're to fill the form in this order:

1. **Certificate Image:** This is an image representation of the certificate that would be minted to each student at the end of a .  &#x20;
2. **Program:** This is the name of the program that the certificate would be issued for.
3. **Year:** This is supposed to hold the year the program held.

* Click on the Upload file button on the form. this is very important as it sends out the certificate and data to IPFS then sends the generated CID to the organizations contract. Note: Please ensure to wait till the upload is completed onchain and you get a toast notification stating that&#x20;
* Finally click on the Submit button on the modal to submit, the certificate issuance request on chain.
