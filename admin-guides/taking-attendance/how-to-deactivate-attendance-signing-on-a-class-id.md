# üõ†Ô∏è How to deactivate attendance signing on a class Id

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please Note:** For a more secured, documented and accountable utilization of ClassMates+, it is advisable to deactivate signing of attendance after a brief window, this is so as to ensure that only students present in class and aware of the brief window can utilize that opportunity to sign attendance.
{% endhint %}

* Navigate to the Attendance section of the dApp, all previously created attendance Id's should be visible at this point.&#x20;
* Locate the attendance you wish to deactivate then click on the view button on the attendance card.&#x20;
